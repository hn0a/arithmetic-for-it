## Implementing the Chinese Remainder Theorem in OCaml

### Image of the Chinese Remainder Map
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) provides a way to uniquely represent integers with a system of modular congruences. The function `crt_image` calculates the image of an integer `x` in a modular system defined by a list of pairwise relatively prime integers `l`. Essentially, it converts `x` into a series of remainders that correspond to each modulus in `l`.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function CRTImage(x, l)
    Initialize an empty list image
    For each modulus in l
        Compute the remainder of x divided by the modulus
        Add the remainder to the image list
    End For
    Return image
End Function
```

### Inverse Image of Chinese Remainder Map
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The inverse function, `crt_solver`, reconstructs an integer from its representation in a modular system. Given a positive integer `m`, a list `l` of pairwise relatively prime factors of `m`, and a list `y` of remainders, this function finds the unique integer that corresponds to these modular conditions under the CRT.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function CRTSolver(m, l, y)
    Initialize an integer solution
    For each element in l
        Apply the modular inverse and other CRT techniques to solve for the integer
        Update the solution accordingly
    End For
    Return the solution
End Function
```

**Fact:** The Chinese Remainder Theorem is not only a cornerstone in number theory but also a practical tool in computational mathematics, allowing the simplification of complex modular arithmetic problems.

**Tip:** The effectiveness of the CRT in solving congruences lies in its ability to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones, particularly useful in cryptography and parallel computing.
