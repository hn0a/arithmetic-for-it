# Tweaking OCaml Built-in Euclidean Division

## Adjustments to OCaml's Euclidean Division to Align with Standard Mathematical Conventions

### Sign Function
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The sign function determines the sign of an integer `x`. It returns `1` if `x` is non-negative (zero or positive) and `-1` if `x` is negative. This function is fundamental in ensuring that division operations adhere to mathematical conventions, especially when dealing with negative numbers.

### Quotient of an Integer by a Natural Number
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
This function calculates the quotient in the Euclidean division sense of an integer `a` (the dividend) by a natural number `b`. It accounts for the sign of the numbers to ensure compliance with standard mathematical rules. The function iteratively subtracts `b` from `a` and counts how many times this operation is performed until `a` is less than `b`, thereby determining the quotient.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Quotient(a, b)
    If a > 0
        (Perform iterative subtraction to find the quotient)
    Else
        (Adjust the method for negative a)
    End If
    Return quotient adjusted for sign
End Function
```

### Modulo of Two Integers
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
This function calculates the modulo (`r`) of two integers `a` and `b`, following the Euclidean division. Unlike the default OCaml behavior, this ensures that the result is a positive integer between 0 (included) and `b` (excluded), conforming to standard mathematical practices.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Modulo(a, b)
    Calculate quotient q as a / b
    Calculate remainder r as a - q * b
    If r < 0, adjust it to be positive
    Return r
End Function
```

### Division of Two Integers
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
This function computes the division of two integers `a` and `b`, providing both the quotient and the remainder as per the Euclidean division. It uses the previously defined quotient function and ensures that the remainder conforms to standard mathematical conventions.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Division(a, b)
    Calculate quotient q using the Quotient function
    Calculate remainder r as a - q * b
    Adjust r if negative
    Return (q, r)
End Function
```

**Fact:** Standard mathematical conventions for division, especially regarding negative numbers, are not always followed in programming languages, requiring such tweaks for accurate mathematical computations.

**Tip:** Understanding these nuances is crucial for implementing algorithms that rely on precise mathematical operations, especially in fields like cryptography and numerical analysis.
