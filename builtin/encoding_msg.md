## Techniques for Converting Strings to and from Integer Representations

### Encoding ASCII Characters in a String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `encode` function converts a string of ASCII characters into an integer representation. Each character in the string `str` is represented using a specified number of bits, typically 7 for alphanumeric ASCII characters. The function iteratively multiplies each character's ASCII code by an increasing power of 2 (based on its position in the string) and sums them to form a single integer.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Encode(str, bits)
    For each character in str, from last to first
        Convert character to ASCII code
        Multiply by appropriate power of 2
        Add to total
    Return the encoded integer
End Function
```

### Decoding an Integer to an ASCII String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `decode` function reverses the encoding process, transforming an integer back into a string. It iteratively divides the integer by a power of 2 (based on the specified number of bits per character) and uses the remainder to find the corresponding ASCII character. The process continues until the entire integer is decomposed into characters.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Decode(msg, bits)
    Initialize an empty string msgstr
    While msg is not 0
        Calculate character from remainder of msg divided by power of 2
        Prepend character to msgstr
        Divide msg by power of 2
    Return the decoded string
End Function
```

**Fact:** Encoding and decoding are fundamental operations in computer science, allowing for efficient storage and transmission of data.

**Tip:** Understanding these encoding techniques is crucial in fields like data compression and cryptography, where data representation plays a key role in process efficiency and security.
