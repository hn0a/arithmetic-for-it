## Implementing String Encoding and Decoding with Bitarrays

### Encoding ASCII Characters in a String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `encode` function converts a string of ASCII characters into a bitarray. Each character in the string `str` is encoded using a specified number of bits (typically 7 for alphanumeric ASCII). The function transforms each character into its binary form and concatenates these binary sequences into a single bitarray.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Encode(str, bits)
    For each character in str
        Convert character to its binary representation using `bits` bits
        Append the binary form to the resulting bitarray
    Return the encoded bitarray
End Function
```

### Decoding a Bitarray to an ASCII String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `decode` function reverses the encoding process, transforming a bitarray back into a string. It iteratively extracts binary sequences corresponding to each character and converts them back to ASCII characters.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Decode(msg, bits)
    While there are bits left in msg
        Extract a binary sequence representing a character
        Convert the binary sequence to the corresponding ASCII character
        Append this character to the resulting string
    Return the decoded string
End Function
```

**Fact:** Encoding and decoding strings into bitarrays are fundamental operations in computer science, used in data compression, cryptography, and digital communication.

**Tip:** Efficient encoding and decoding algorithms are crucial for performance in systems where data representation and manipulation are key, such as in cryptography and network communications.
