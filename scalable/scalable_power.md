# Power Function Implementations for Bitarrays

## Implementing Various Power Functions with Bitarrays

### Naive Power Function (Linear Complexity)
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `pow` function calculates the power of a bitarray base `x` raised to a bitarray exponent `n`. It follows a straightforward, linear approach by recursively multiplying `x` by itself `n` times.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Pow(x, n)
    If n is zero or empty, return 1 as a bitarray
    Else recursively multiply x by itself n times
End Function
```

### Fast Bitarray Exponentiation (Logarithmic Complexity)
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `power` function improves efficiency using a logarithmic approach. It reduces the number of multiplications needed by squaring the base and halving the exponent in each recursive step.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Power(x, n)
    If n is zero or empty, return 1 as a bitarray
    Perform recursive fast exponentiation
End Function
```

### Fast Modular Exponentiation
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `mod_power` function extends fast exponentiation to modular arithmetic with bitarrays. It calculates `(x^n) mod m` efficiently, ensuring intermediate results remain within bounds of the modular base `m`.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function ModPower(x, n, m)
    Perform fast modular exponentiation
    Adjust and return the result within bounds of m
End Function
```

### Fast Modular Exponentiation Mod Prime
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
`prime_mod_power` optimizes modular exponentiation for a prime modular base `p`, leveraging properties like Fermat's Little Theorem. It's especially useful in cryptographic applications where such optimizations are crucial.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function PrimeModPower(x, n, p)
    Perform fast modular exponentiation mod prime
    Adjust and return the result within bounds of p
End Function
```

**Fact:** Fast exponentiation techniques are critical in computational mathematics and cryptography, where large exponents are commonly used.

**Tip:** Efficiently implementing these power functions with bitarrays is key for handling large numbers in cryptographic algorithms.
