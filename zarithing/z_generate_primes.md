## Implementing Prime Number Generation with Big Integers

### Initializing List for Eratosthenes' Sieve
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The function `init_eratosthenes` initializes a list for the sieve of Eratosthenes using big integers from the Z module. It creates a list of big integers starting with 2 and followed by all odd integers up to a specified upper limit `n`.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function InitEratosthenes(n)
    Create a list starting with 2
    Add all odd integers up to n to the list
    Return the list
End Function
```

### Eratosthenes' Sieve for Prime Generation
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `eratosthenes` function implements the sieve of Eratosthenes for big integers. It finds all prime numbers up to a given limit `n` by iteratively removing non-prime numbers from the list initialized by `init_eratosthenes`.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Eratosthenes(n)
    Initialize a list of big integers using InitEratosthenes
    Remove non-prime numbers from the list
    Return the list of prime numbers
End Function
```

### Finding Special Prime Pairs
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `double_primes` function finds pairs of prime numbers where the second prime is twice the first plus one. This function is useful for generating prime pairs with specific properties, often used in cryptographic applications.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function DoublePrimes(limit, isprime)
    Generate a list of primes up to limit using Eratosthenes
    Find and return pairs where the second prime is twice the first plus one
End Function
```

**Fact:** The sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic and efficient method for finding prime numbers, and its implementation with big integers allows handling larger numbers.

**Tip:** Efficient prime number generation is crucial in cryptography, where primes form the basis of algorithms like RSA and ElGamal.
