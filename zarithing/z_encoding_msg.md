## Implementing String Encoding and Decoding with Big Integers

### Encoding ASCII Characters in a String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `encode` function is designed to convert a string of ASCII characters into a big integer representation. Each character in the string `str` is encoded using a specified number of bits, typically 7 for alphanumeric ASCII. The function should transform each character into its binary form and concatenate these binary sequences into a single big integer.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Encode(str, bits)
    For each character in str
        Convert character to its binary representation using `bits` bits
        Concatenate the binary form to form a big integer
    Return the encoded big integer
End Function
```

### Decoding a Big Integer to an ASCII String
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `decode` function is intended to reverse the encoding process, transforming a big integer back into a string. It should extract binary sequences corresponding to each character from the big integer and convert them back to ASCII characters.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function Decode(msg, bits)
    Extract binary sequences representing characters from msg
    Convert each binary sequence to the corresponding ASCII character
    Concatenate these characters to form the decoded string
End Function
```

**Fact:** Encoding and decoding strings into big integers are fundamental operations in computer science, used in areas like data compression, cryptography, and digital communication.

**Tip:** Efficient encoding and decoding algorithms are crucial for performance in systems where data representation and manipulation are key, such as in cryptography and network communications.
