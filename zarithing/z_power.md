## Implementing Fast Power and Modular Exponentiation for Big Integers

### Fast Modular Exponentiation
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `mod_power` function efficiently computes `(x^n) mod m` for big integers. It uses a logarithmic approach to reduce the complexity by squaring the base and halving the exponent in each recursive step, ensuring that the results remain within the modular base `m`.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function ModPower(x, n, m)
    If n is zero, return 1
    Else, recursively compute the power with modulo in each step
    Adjust and return the result within bounds of m
End Function
```

### Fast Modular Exponentiation Mod Prime
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
`prime_mod_power` optimizes modular exponentiation for a prime modular base `p`, leveraging properties like Fermat's Little Theorem. This function is particularly useful in cryptographic contexts where efficient modular exponentiation is crucial.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function PrimeModPower(x, n, p)
    Use Fermat's Little Theorem for optimization
    Perform fast modular exponentiation mod prime
    Adjust and return the result within bounds of p
End Function
```

**Fact:** Fast modular exponentiation is a cornerstone in computational mathematics and cryptography, enabling efficient calculations in algorithms like RSA.

**Tip:** Efficiently implementing these power functions with big integers is key for handling large numbers in cryptographic algorithms and other applications requiring modular arithmetic.
