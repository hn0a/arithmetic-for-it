## Implementing a Deterministic Primality Test for Big Integers

### Deterministic Primality Test
**Explanation in Natural Language:**  
The `is_prime` function tests if a big integer `n` is prime. It checks if `n` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If a divisor is found, `n` is not prime; otherwise, it is prime. This method is deterministic and accurate for big integers.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```
Function IsPrime(n)
    If n is less than 2, return false
    Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n
    Return true if no divisors found, else false
End Function
```

**Fact:** Deterministic primality testing is a crucial operation in number theory and cryptography, especially for identifying prime numbers for cryptographic key generation.

**Tip:** While deterministic tests for primality are precise, they can be computationally intensive for very large numbers, highlighting the importance of efficient algorithms in such contexts.
